NAME
       acti - Activate Apps.


SYNOPSIS
       acti <options> <subcommand> <APP>


REQUIREMENT
       Dmenu, GNU Sed, Wmctrl


OPTIONAL
       Xmessage


DESCRIPTION
        Acti  is  a Bash shell script that allows you to activate win‐
       dows being managed by the window manager or  to  execute  Apps.
       Currently,  it  maintains  a  File of Apps, acts like a kind of
       application launcher and can resize and move windows of an  App
       at the same time.


OPTIONS
       --gui
              Start acti in interactive GUI mode with Dmenus.


       -e X,Y,W,H
              Activate single window of an App with sizing.


       -gh
              Arrange  horizontaly  all  windows  of an App on current
              desktop in a grid of equal sizes.


       -gv
              Arrange verticaly all windows of an App on current desk‐
              top in a grid of equal sizes.


       -m
              Maximize  all  windows  of an App on current desktop. In
              GUI mode the last window is set on top. This  option  in
              CLI  mode  is  like  the w_action=activate_all, which is
              default in both modes.


SUBCOMMANDS
   CLI & GUI MODE
       gui APP
              Execute APP with own options without checking its  list‐
              ing in the App File.


       term APP

              Display a help.


   GUI MODE only
       acti
              Prompt a second Dmenu, where commands can be selected.


       history
              Like 'show history', but interactive with a Dmenu.



       GRID_HORIZONTAL
              Arranges all windows of an App on current desktop  in  a
              grid of equal sizes. Acti begins to tile horizontaly.


       GRID_VERTICAL
              Arranges  all  windows of an App on current desktop in a
              grid of equal sizes. Acti begins to tile verticaly.


       MAXIMIZE
              Maximizes all windows of an App on current  desktop  and
              sets then the last activated on top.


       CLOSE_ALL
              Closes all windows of an App on current desktop.


       MV_TO_DESKTOP
              Prompts  a  Dmenu,  where MV_AND_SWITCH_TO DESKTOP moves
              all windows of an App  on  current  desktop  to  another
              desktop     and     switches     to     that    desktop.
              MV_TO_BUT_STAY DESKTOP  does  the  same,   but   without
              switching to that desktop.


       CYCLE  Acti  reads  window  identities  with "wmctrl -l", which
              lists all windows in order of mapping/arising. Is  there
              more  than one window of an App on current desktop, then
              their ids are stored in an Array.  CYCLE  redefines  the
              Array  and  reorders  the  strings  by  putting the last
              string to the beginning. This way Acti can "reload"  the
              ids  without  quitting,  and  in turn that is useful for
              arranging the arranged windows. Short: Reorders windows.
              The cycle continues clockwisely.

       thunar


       term task next


USAGE
       First of all fit the parameters in Config File into your  posi‐
       tion.  You  need  to  set  $utils_dir, $app_file, $backup_file,
       $app_dir, $backup_dir and $history_file. Then  include  minimum
       one  App  into  the  App File. You can mask lines with "block",
       "ign" or "reg": "block" means, that an App can not be  executed
       or  activated;  "ign"  means, that an App can only be executed,
       but can not be activated; "reg" means, that an App can be acti‐
       vated.  Apps  which are not listed in the App File, will not be
       displayed in Dmenu and can not be  entered.  To  execute  those
       Apps, you can use commands term and gui.

       After  that  you  can  also edit the File in Dmenu or invoke an
       Editor, too. Further you may edit the App File on command line.
       If  you want to, you may type also several commands in one line
       to edit the App File.

       Then choose or enter any other App in Dmenu. Is there more than
       one  window  of an App, Dmenu provides a second selection menu.
       There you can activate every window separately or size and move
       all windows of an App on current desktop at the same time. Acti
       uses "wmctrl -a", so if you choose an App that  is  on  another
       desktop, first Acti switches to that desktop and then activates
       the window.

       Instead of that, you may type list in Dmenu and choose  between
       all the windows being managed by the window manager.

       Example:  You  are  on desktop 0. You use a shortcut to execute
       Acti. In Dmenu you type thunar. Then you see,  that  there  are
       three  maximized  windows  open  on desktop 0 and one maximized
       window open on desktop 1. But you want to see  all  windows  at
       the  same  time. So you type/select GRID_VERTICAL. Now you want
       to change the order of the tiled windows. Type/Select CYCLE and
       after that GRID_VERTICAL again. The first window is now on sec‐
       ond position and the last window on first. You decide on moving
       the  tiled  windows on desktop 1. You type/select MV_TO_DESKTOP
       and then MV_AND_SWITCH_TO 1. Now you stand on  desktop  1.  You
       type GRID_VERTICAL again and you can see that the fourth window
       is tiled too. After all you type/select CLOSE_ALL. All  windows
       of  thunar  are  now killed. You press "Escape" to quit Dmenu -
       and Acti.

       In  CLI  mode  you  may  activate  an  App  for  example   with
       acti -gh -e 0,0,1280,400 APP.  Is there only one window of APP,
       that window will be sized before activation; instead  all  win‐
       dows  of  APP  will  be arranged horizontaly in a grid of equal
       sizes.

       Moreover you can edit the Desktop File of an  App  and  do  the
       sizing  and  activation without command line arguments. Command
       line has priority before Desktop File.

DESKTOP FILES
       Every App in the App File points to a Desktop File with parame‐
       ters  in the App Dir, which are read when processing. Some com‐
       mand line arguments overwrite these  settings.  Currently,  not
       all parameters are implemented in Acti. A Desktop File can con‐
       tain:

       Encoding=UTF-8

       Version=1.0

       Type=Application

CUSTOMIZATION
       To integrate Scripts with other Dmenu in Acti, you  can  modify
       "acti_custom.sh" in the Utils Dir.


NOTES
   Dmenu
       For  xft  support  to  Dmenu  you  need  to  patch  Dmenu.  See
       http://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/patches/xft   or   https://bit‐
       bucket.org/melek/dmenu2.

       See also https://bitbucket.org/rafaelgg/slmenu.


   Xmessage
       You  can  put  these  options  below  into $HOME/.Xresources or
       $HOME/.Xdefaults to edit settings of Xmessage. Then  restart  X
       or  type  "xrdb  ~/.Xresources". Maybe you prefer to undecorate
       the  Xmessage  Window,  so  the  default  name/title  is  xmes‐
       sage:acti.
